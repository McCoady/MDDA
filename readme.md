Fully on chain decentralized dutch auction with decrementing price tiers and a refund system based on ending price

If used as is, contract is unruggable by an admin. 

Withdraw funds only returns quantity * final price.

Standard is in contacts/MDDA.sol

Implementation Example is in contracts/NFT.sol

CURRENT VERSION IS HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL AND COULD INCLUDE A MYRIAD OF BREAKING BUGS, NOT TO BE USED WITHOUT EXTREME DISCRECTION.

Amount of unit tests is currently very low and not very helpful due to me having not done it yet.
